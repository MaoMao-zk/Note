[Github will not support math renderring in markdown.](https://github.com/github/markup/issues/897)  
a good suggetion:
```
I think an officially supported maths plugin in browser would over time would be best solution. The rendering and security problems would be limited to client (think flash updates).
It need not be drab - throw the kitchen sink at it. Allowing some maths input. While the mathjax plugin works for rendering - it falls short in input.

Just For Test:  
$f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$  
$$f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$$
